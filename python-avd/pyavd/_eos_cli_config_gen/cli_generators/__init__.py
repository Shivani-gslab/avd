CLI configuration generators for EOS CLI Config Gen.

This package contains Python-based CLI configuration generators that replace Jinja2 templates.
Each generator is a class that inherits from CliGenerator and uses @cli_config_contributor
decorator to mark methods that generate CLI configuration snippets.

Two patterns are supported:
1. Return string pattern (old): Methods return CLI strings
2. Append pattern (new): Methods append to self.cli_config (similar to self.structured_config in eos_designs)
